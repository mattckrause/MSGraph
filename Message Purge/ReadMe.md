# Message Purge Sample Script

## Description

A sample PowerShell script I created to purge messages from mailboxes using Microsoft Graph API.  
The sample reads in a list of mailboxes and messages from a .CSV file.

The script is expecting Application Permissions (Client Secret/App ID). So AAD app registrations should be done accordingly.
